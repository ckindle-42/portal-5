# P5_ROADMAP.md — Portal 5 Future Enhancements

```
Portal 6.0.0 Roadmap
==================
Last updated: April 7, 2026
Version: 6.0.0 (production-ready)

LEGEND: P1=Critical, P2=High, P3=Medium
STATUS: DONE, IN_PROGRESS, FUTURE
```

All v5.0–v5.2 items are marked DONE in CHANGELOG.md. This document tracks
genuinely open future work beyond the current stable release.

## Future Considerations (Not Yet Implemented)

| ID | Priority | Title | Status | Notes |
|----|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| P5-FUT-003 | P3 | Usage analytics dashboard | DONE | Grafana portal5_overview.json v3: 6 new panels — workspace request trends, tokens by workspace, top workspaces, model×workspace breakdown, request rate. All queries use existing Prometheus metrics. Per-user blocked — Open WebUI doesn't expose user IDs to Pipeline. |
| P5-FUT-004 | P3 | Webhook-based event notifications | DONE | WebhookChannel implemented (portal_pipeline/notifications/channels/webhook.py). Env vars: WEBHOOK_URL, WEBHOOK_HEADERS. POSTs JSON to arbitrary HTTP endpoint on all alert and summary events. Live-verified 2026-03-30. |
| P5-FUT-005 | P2 | Weighted keyword scoring for content-aware routing | DONE | Replaced regex-based `_detect_workspace` with weighted keyword scoring. Each keyword carries weight 1-3 (weak/medium/strong), workspaces have activation thresholds, highest score above threshold wins. Handles overlapping signals naturally (e.g. "exploit in Python" → security wins, not coding). Implemented in v5.2.1. |
| P5-FUT-006 | P1 | LLM-based intent routing (replaces keyword matching) | DONE | DONE in v6.0.0. hf.co/QuantFactory/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-abliterated-GGUF (uncensored), JSON schema enforcement, keyword fallback on confidence < 0.5 or timeout. |
| P5-FUT-009 | P2 | Model-size-aware admission control (MLX proxy) | DONE | DONE in v6.0.0. MODEL_MEMORY dict (16 entries), MEMORY_HEADROOM_GB (10GB), HTTP 503 with actionable message, unknown-model default. |

## Implementation Notes

### P5-FUT-003: Usage Analytics Dashboard

IMPLEMENTED: `portal5_overview.json` v3 adds 6 new Usage Analytics panels (ids 13-18):
workspace request trends, tokens by workspace, top workspaces, model×workspace matrix, and
current request rate. All use existing Prometheus metrics — no new instrumentation needed.

Per-user analytics remain blocked: Open WebUI does not expose user IDs to the Pipeline.

### P5-FUT-004: Webhook-Based Event Notifications

IMPLEMENTED: `WebhookChannel` (`portal_pipeline/notifications/channels/webhook.py`) sends
JSON POST to any user-defined HTTP endpoint on all alert and daily summary events.
Configure via `WEBHOOK_URL` and optional `WEBHOOK_HEADERS` (JSON object) env vars.
Live-verified: a `config_error` test event was confirmed delivered to a listening endpoint.

### P5-FUT-006: LLM-Based Intent Routing

IMPLEMENTED in v6.0.0 (`portal_pipeline/router_pipe.py`). `_route_with_llm()` uses
`hf.co/QuantFactory/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-abliterated-GGUF` as a semantic intent classifier, replacing keyword-based
workspace detection for the primary routing path.

**What was built:**
- `_route_with_llm()` in `router_pipe.py` — Ollama grammar-enforced JSON output (guaranteed valid workspace ID + confidence)
- `temperature: 0`, `num_predict: 20`, `num_ctx: 512` — deterministic, fast; `keep_alive: "-1"` keeps model loaded
- Falls back to `_detect_workspace()` on `confidence < 0.5` or timeout
- `config/routing_descriptions.json` — operator-editable workspace capability descriptions
- `config/routing_examples.json` — 25 few-shot routing examples (operator-editable)
- 16 unit tests in `tests/unit/test_routing.py` (mocked Ollama)

**Configuration (`.env`):**
```
LLM_ROUTER_ENABLED=true
LLM_ROUTER_MODEL=hf.co/QuantFactory/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-abliterated-GGUF
LLM_ROUTER_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.5
LLM_ROUTER_TIMEOUT_MS=500
LLM_ROUTER_OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
```

### P5-FUT-009: Model-Size-Aware Admission Control (MLX Proxy)

IMPLEMENTED in v6.0.0 (`scripts/mlx-proxy.py`). The CLAUDE.md coexistence table is now
self-enforcing — the proxy rejects model loads that would exceed available memory before
evicting the current model.

**What was built:**
- `MODEL_MEMORY` dict: 16 model tags → estimated GB (sourced from CLAUDE.md catalog)
- `_check_memory_for_model()`: pre-flight check in `ensure_server()` before any model switch
- Rejects with HTTP 503 + actionable message (e.g. "Model needs ~46GB, only 30GB free — stop ComfyUI or unload Ollama first")
- `MEMORY_HEADROOM_GB` env var replaces the hardcoded 10GB floor
- `MLX_MEMORY_UNKNOWN_DEFAULT_GB` env var controls the assumed size for unrecognized models
- 9 unit tests in `tests/unit/test_mlx_proxy.py` (mocked memory reads)

**Configuration (`.env`):**
```
MLX_MEMORY_HEADROOM_GB=10
MLX_MEMORY_UNKNOWN_DEFAULT_GB=20
```
