# Portal 6.0.0 — Admin Guide

## First Login

After `./launch.sh up`, credentials are printed to the console and saved in `.env`.
Log in at `http://localhost:8080` with the generated admin account.

## User Management

### Approve Pending Users
1. Admin Panel > Users
2. Find users with "pending" role
3. Click the user > set role to "user"

### Create Users via CLI
```bash
./launch.sh add-user alice@team.local "Alice Smith"
./launch.sh add-user bob@team.local "Bob Jones" admin
./launch.sh list-users
```

### User Roles
- `pending` — cannot use the system, waiting for approval
- `user` — standard access to workspaces, tools, chat
- `admin` — full access including user management and all settings

## Model Management

### Pull Additional Models
```bash
./launch.sh pull-models
# Pulls: xploiter, whiterabbitneo, baronllm, tongyi, qwen3-coder, devstral, etc.
# Takes 30-90 minutes depending on connection speed
```

### Add a Cluster Node
Edit `config/backends.yaml` — see `docs/CLUSTER_SCALE.md`.

## Routine Operations

```bash
./launch.sh status      # Check service health
./launch.sh logs        # Pipeline logs (default)
./launch.sh logs ollama # Ollama logs
./launch.sh seed        # Re-seed workspaces/personas (after config changes)
./launch.sh down        # Stop all services (data preserved)
./launch.sh clean       # Wipe Open WebUI data (fresh start, Ollama models kept)
```

## Security Notes

- Generated secrets are in `.env` — never commit this file
- PIPELINE_API_KEY protects the routing API — rotate if compromised
- WEBUI_SECRET_KEY secures user sessions — rotation requires all users to re-login
- To rotate secrets: edit `.env`, restart stack

## Network Exposure

Portal 5 is designed for single-machine local use. After applying the recommended configuration, Open WebUI binds to `127.0.0.1` and is only accessible from `localhost`.

**To access from other machines on your network (LAN):**
1. Set up a reverse proxy (Caddy or nginx) on the same machine
2. Proxy from a public-facing port to `127.0.0.1:8080`
3. Configure TLS (HTTPS) — never serve Open WebUI over plain HTTP across a network
4. Consider adding HTTP Basic Auth at the proxy layer for an additional authentication factor

**Never expose port 8080 directly to the internet.**

The pipeline API (port 9099) and all MCP servers (8910–8916) are always bound to 127.0.0.1 and are not reachable externally under any configuration.

## Backup

Critical data is in Docker volumes:
- `portal-5_open-webui-data` — all user accounts, chat history, settings
- `portal-5_ollama-models` — downloaded model weights (replaceable, not personal data)

```bash
# Backup Open WebUI data
docker run --rm -v portal-5_open-webui-data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup \
    alpine tar czf /backup/openwebui-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /data
```
