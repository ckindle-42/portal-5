# Known Limitations

Architectural and design constraints that cannot be resolved without significant tradeoffs. These are accepted as part of Portal 5's design.

## Security

### Code Sandbox Requires Privileged Container
- **ID**: P5-ROAD-SEC-001
- **Description**: The `dind` (Docker-in-Docker) service runs with `privileged: true`. Docker-in-Docker cannot function without host kernel capabilities.
- **Impact**: In hardened environments, a compromised sandbox container could potentially escape to host.
- **Mitigation**: Either disable the code sandbox by removing `mcp-sandbox` and `dind` services from `docker-compose.yml`, or apply host-level controls (AppArmor/seccomp profile on the Docker daemon).

### No Built-in Multi-User Rate Limiting
- **ID**: P5-ROAD-031
- **Description**: Open WebUI does not have per-user rate limiting. A single user in a multi-user deployment could exhaust server resources.
- **Mitigation**: Deploy behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik) with rate limiting, or use Open WebUI's admin controls to set per-user quotas.

## Infrastructure

### ComfyUI Runs Outside Docker
- **Description**: ComfyUI runs on the host (not in Docker) to access GPU directly (MPS on Apple Silicon, CUDA on NVIDIA). This is required for image/video generation performance.
- **Impact**: Manual setup required outside the `./launch.sh up` flow. On first run after a fresh machine, ComfyUI must be installed separately.
- **Documentation**: See `docs/COMFYUI_SETUP.md`
- **Mitigation**: `./launch.sh install-comfyui` handles the setup on supported platforms.

### Voice Cloning (fish-speech) Requires Separate Installation
- **Description**: Voice cloning via `fish-speech` is not included in the Docker stack — it requires host-side installation.
- **Impact**: Voice cloning is unavailable; TTS still works via the included `kokoro-onnx` engine.
- **Documentation**: See `docs/FISH_SPEECH_SETUP.md`
- **Mitigation**: `kokoro-onnx` provides text-to-speech out of the box with no extra setup.
